    // https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-hire-k-workers
    // There are n workers. You are given two integer arrays quality and wage where quality[i] is the quality of the ith worker and wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.
    //We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:
    //    Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
    //    In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality. This means if a workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker in the group, then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.
    //Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
